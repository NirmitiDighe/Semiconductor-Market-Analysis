# Description – 
The dataset contains 358 observations with 6 columns. These variables include the company - name of the semiconductor company, sector - the company where it belongs to, rank - company rank based on its market capitalization, market cap - market capitalization of company in USD dollars and Industry - specific to its sector. The response variable varies based on the part of analysis. The suitable response variable can be market capitalization, country or sector variables.

Hypothesis testing for one sample, two sample inferences, ANOVA and chi-square tests to be carried out to find relevant conclusions based on the significant differences amongst market capitalizations, country or sector of the companies. 
3.	Perform linear, logistic regression to understand the relationship between the response variable and the predictor variables.
